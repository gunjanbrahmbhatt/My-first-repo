Internship Summary - AI/ML Domain

Name: [Your Full Name]
Internship Duration: [Start Date] - [End Date]
Domain: Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning
Topics Covered: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview:
---------
During the course of my internship, I worked on foundational concepts and practical applications in the field of Machine Learning, with a strong focus on supervised learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. The internship allowed me to deepen my understanding of model development, evaluation, and the data preprocessing pipeline.

Key Learnings and Activities:
-----------------------------
1. *Linear Regression*
   - Understood the principles behind linear regression.
   - Built and evaluated models to predict continuous outcomes.
   - Explored metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score for model performance.

2. *Logistic Regression*
   - Learned how logistic regression is used for binary classification problems.
   - Implemented models to predict categorical outcomes.
   - Worked with evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
   - Performed data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization).
   - Conducted statistical analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
   - Visualized data using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover insights and correlations.

Tools & Technologies Used:
--------------------------
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

Project Highlights (Optional Section):
--------------------------------------
[Include any mini-projects or datasets you worked on, such as predicting house prices, customer churn analysis, etc.]

Conclusion:
-----------
This internship has strengthened my foundation in machine learning and data analytics, and provided practical exposure to real-world datasets and modeling workflows. I am now better equipped to handle end-to-end ML projects and continue learning advanced topics in this field.
